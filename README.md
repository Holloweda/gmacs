# Gmac: Generalized Modeling for Alaskan Crab Stocks #

This repository holds code and instructions for Gmacs (Generalized Modeling for Alaskan Crab Stocks), a generic size-based stock assessment model. 

## Modelling structure and format ##

Gmacs implements a size-structured modelling framework with flexibility similar to that provided by other general stock assessment modelling frameworks. In particular, effort has been made to maintain consistency with data and control file formats familiar to users of Stock Synthesis.

# CHANGES to GMACS for May 2014 CPT.
# List of changes to Gmacs since fist pilot version:

(1) 	Generic functions at end of code, now exported to Cstar.
(2) 	Selectivity functions exported to Cstar.
(3) 	Cstar selectivity functions used in code (more options available).
(4) 	When number of classes in data and model are same, class link matrix not required. Automatically generated instead.
(5) 	When number of classes in the data and the model differ by an integer factor, class link matrix is automatically generated. 
(6) 	When number of classes in the data is not a multiple of number of classes in the model, read in class_link matrix.
(7) 	Names of fleets and surveys now printed correctly to echoinput file.
(8) 	All references in model are now to size-classes rather than length classes.
(9) 	Functionality improved for writeR: Fleet and survey names now exported to R and used for plots.
(10) 	Gmacs R Functions now wrapped in simple 'gmplot_all' function, can be used with any model.
(11)	Fleet control section of data file is now extended to include surveys, catch units and multipliers, all entered in the one matrix. This is to prepare to future options where a fishing fleet might also have a 'survey' such as a CPUE index, and where a survey might have some catch.
(12)	Data file now expects extra dimensions to be specified, such as number of shell and maturity types.

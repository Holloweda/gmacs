  \section*{Introduction} % (fold)
  \label{sec:introduction}
  
  Statistical catch age models have several advantages over simple production type models in that age and size composition data can be used to better inform structural features such as recruitment variability, and total mortality rates.  There are a number of generic age-structured models in use today, but there are very few generic size-based, or staged based models that are used in stock assessment.

  In this paper we describe a generalized statistical catch-at-length model that is well suited for animals that cannot be aged, and only precise length measurements are available. The description is based on a crustaceans that undergo molting and with each subsequent molt increase in length.

  The analytical details of the generalized model is summarized using tables of equations (e.g., Table \ref{tab:equilibrium_model}).   These tables serve two purposes: (1) to clearly provide the logical order in which calculations proceed, and (2) organization of a relatively large integrated model into a series of sub-models that represent specific components such as population dynamics, observation models, reference point calculations, fisheries dynamics, and the objective function.  We first start with a description of the population dynamics under steady-state (equilibrium) conditions.  Model notation and a description of symbols are provided in Table \ref{tab:notation}.

    \subsection*{Equilibrium considerations} % (fold)
    \label{sub:equilibrium_considerations}
    Parameters for the population sub model are represented by the vector $\Theta$ (\ref{T1.1} in Table \ref{tab:equilibrium_model}), which consists of the natural mortality rate, average-recruitment, initial recruitment in the first year, parameters that describe the size-distribution of new recruits, and stock-recruitment parameters (see Table \ref{tab:notation} for notation).  Constraints for these model parameters are defined in \eqref{T1.2}.  Assuming the molt increments are linear, growth following each molt is a parametric function with the parameters defined in $\Phi$.

    The model is based on a set of user defined size categories. We assume at any time the population consists of a vector where each component of the vector consists of a number of individuals in some size category. The size category intervals and mid points of those intervals are defined by \eqref{T1.3}.  Average molt increments from size category $l$ to the next is assumed to be sex-specific, and is defined by a linear function \eqref{T1.4}.  The probability of transitioning from  size category $l$ to $l'$ assumed that variation in molt increments follows a Gamma distribution \eqref{T1.5}, and the size-transition matrix for each sex $h$ is denoted as $\pmb{G}_h$.  

    The size distribution of new recruits is assumed to follow a gamma distribution \eqref{T1.7} with the parameters $\alpha_r$ and $\beta_r$.  The gamma distribution is scaled such that $\alpha_r$ is the mode of the distribution and could potentially be obtained from empirical size composition data.  The vector of new recruits at each time step \eqref{T1.8} assumes a 50:50 sex ratio.

    For unfished conditions that are subject only to sex-specific natural mortality $M_h$ rates, we assume that each year members of the population grow and experience mortality.  The basic assumption is that this process is a linear function of the numbers in each size category, where the categories are separated by  sex to accommodate differential growth and survival rates.  Survival and growth at each time step in unfished conditions is based on \eqref{T1.10}, where $(\pmb{I}_n)_{l,l'}$ is the identity matrix and $M_h$ is a scaler. It's also possible to accommodate size-specific natural mortality rates in \eqref{T1.10} where $M_h$ represents a vector of length-specific natural mortality rates.

    Assuming a non-zero steady-state fishing mortality rate vector $\pmb{f}$, the equilibrium growth and survival process is represented by \eqref{T1.12}.  The vector $\bm{f}_h$ represents all mortality associated with fishing, including mortality associated with discards in directed and non-directed fisheries.

    Assuming unit recruitment, then the growth and survivorship in unfished and fished conditions is given by the solutions to the matrix equations \eqref{T1.13a} and \eqref{T1.13b}, respectively.   The vectors $\bm{u}_h$ and $\bm{v}_h$ represent the unique equilibrium solution for the numbers per recruit in each size category.  The total unfished numbers in each size category is defined as $R_0 \bm{u}_h$.

    The unfished spawning stock biomass is defined as the equilibrium unfished recruitment multiplied by the sum of products of survivorship per recruit, weight-at-length, and proportion mature-at-length \eqref{T1.14}.  The definition of spawning  biomass may include only the females, or only males, or some combination thereof. To accommodate various definitions of spawning biomass the parameter $\lambda_h$, with the additional constraint $\sum_h \lambda_h = 1$, assigns the relative contribution of each sex to the spawning biomass.  For example, if $\lambda = 1$  then the definition of spawning biomass is determined by a single sex. If $\lambda = 0.5$, the spawning biomass consists of an equal sex ratio.

    Under steady-state conditions where the fishing mortality rate is non zero, \eqref{T1.16} defines the equilibrium spawning biomass based on the survivorship of a fished population.  In this case the equilibrium recruitment $\tilde{R}$ must be defined based on a few additional assumptions; the first of which being the form of the stock-recruitment relationship.  Assuming recruitment follows the familiar asymptotic function, or Beverton-Holt relationship:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:BevertonHolt}
      \tilde{R} = \frac{s_o \tilde{B}}{1 + \beta \tilde{B}},
    \end{equation}
    where $\tilde{B}$ is the equilibrium spawning biomass, $s_o$ is the slope at the origin, and $s_o/\beta$ is the asymptote of the function. The parameters of this model can be derived from the unfished recruitment $R_0$ and the recruitment compensation ratio $\kappa$.  The slope at the origin, or $s_o$, is defined as \eqref{T1.18} with the additional constraint that $\kappa > 1$ for an extant population.  Substituting \eqref{T1.18} into the Beverton-Holt model \eqref{eq:BevertonHolt}, and solving  for $\beta$ yields \eqref{T1.19}.

    Given \eqref{T1.13b} is defined as the vector of individuals per recruit in a fished population, the relative reproductive potential per individual recruit is defined as the sum of products of weight-at-length, maturity-at-length and survivorship-to-length:
    \[
    \phi = \sum_h \lambda_h \sum_l  \bm{v}_{h,l} w_{h,l} m_{h,l}
    \]
    The total equilibrium spawning biomass is defined as $\tilde{B} = \tilde{R} \phi$.  Substituting this expression into \eqref{eq:BevertonHolt} and solving for $\tilde{R}$ results in \eqref{T1.19}.





    % Given initial estimates of the unfished recruitment $R_0$ and the recruitment compensation parameter $\kappa$ we can then derive the stock recruitment parameters from the following Beverton-Holt recruitment model
    % where $B_e$ is the equilibrium spawning biomass, $s_o$ is the maximum survival rate $R_e/B_e$ as $B_e$ tends towards 0, $\beta$ is a density dependent survival rate parameter, and $R_e$ is the equilibrium number of recruits of all size classes ($R_e = \sum_l r_l$). The maximum survival rate at the origin of the stock-recruitment curve is a multiple of the recruits per unit of spawning biomass at unfished conditions.  This results in \eqref{T1.17}, with the additional constraint that $\kappa > 1$.  Equation \ref{T1.18} is derived by solving the above equation for $\beta$, substituting \eqref{T1.17} for $s_o$ and simplifying. If we further assume unit recruitment (i.e., $\ddot{R} = 1$ in eq. \ref{T1.8}), the reproductive potential per recruit can be calculated as:
    % where $\pmb{y}_h$ is the unique equilibrium solution corresponding to the unit recruitment.  This is calculated as
    % \[
    % \pmb{y}_h = -(\pmb{F}_h - (\pmb{I}_n)_{l,l'})^{-1} p(\pmb{r})
    % \]
    % The equilibrium recruitment given steady-state conditions with fishing mortality greater than 0 is defined by \eqref{T1.19}. 

    The equilibrium model defined  in Table \ref{tab:equilibrium_model} is a very concise system of equations from which fisheries reference points are easily derived.  The minimum amount of information that is necessary to derive SPR-based reference points is an estimate of the natural mortality rate, fisheries selectivity, the size-transition matrix (or growth based on molt increment information).  These data alone are sufficient enough to calculate $F_{\rm{SPR}}$, and the only additional requirement for $B_{\rm{SPR}}$ is to have an estimate of unfished recruitment or a specified average recruitment.

    \subsection*{SPR-based reference points} % (fold)
    \label{sub:spr_based_reference_points}
    Reference points based on the Spawning Potential Ratio (SPR) are frequently used as proxies to determine Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  The spawning potential ratio is defined as the ratio of reproductive output in fished conditions relative to unfished conditions.  In the notation used in Table \ref{tab:equilibrium_model} the SPR is defined as
    \begin{equation}
      SPR = \tilde{B}/B_0.
    \end{equation}
    Fishing mortality rates that results in SPR values of 0.3-0.4 are often desirable for approximating maximum sustainable yield \citep{clark2002f}.  To calculate \fspr\ an iterative solution is required to determine the instantaneous fishing mortality rate that is required to achieve the desired SPR level.  For a single fishery this is relatively simple; the fishing mortality rate-at-length vector is the product of selectivity-at-length and fishing effort.  A simple bisection algorithm can then be used to iteratively solve for the value of \fspr\ that results in the target SPR.  In cases where there is one or more fisheries involved, and the selectivities differ among fisheries, the target \fspr\ will depend on the relative differences in selectivities among gears.  Moreover, the allocation of total fishing mortality to each gear has to be specified \textit{a priori}.  The solution to this problem must be negotiated as part of the management process as there are an infinite number of allocation combinations that would result in achieving \fspr.  Given a vector of predefined fishing mortality rate ratios, \fspr\ can then be numerically determined using the same algorithm as the single fishery example.

    The expected spawning biomass level when fishing at \fspr\ is referred to as \bspr.  To calculate \bspr\ we first evaluate \eqref{T1.12} using \fspr\ and then calculate the steady state biomass using \eqref{T1.16}. An alternative way to calculate the SPR-based reference points is to use per recruit quantities, or incidence functions (Table \ref{tab:incidence_fucntions}). For example, the SPR is the ratio of spawning biomass per recruit in fished and unfished populations, or \eqref{T2.3}. For each incidence function the primary difference between the fished and unfished states is the equilibrium numbers at length.  In Table \ref{tab:incidence_fucntions} we used $\phi$ and $\tilde{\phi}$ to represent fished and unfished states.    \bspr\ is given by \eqref{T2.4} and the total catch at \fspr\ is given by \eqref{T2.5}.  Other quantities such as the equilibrium  retained catch, or discards,  when fishing at \fspr\ or any other rate can easily be computed using survivorship-at-length schedules and the equilibrium recruitment (Table \ref{tab:incidence_fucntions}).

    \subsection*{Fishing mortality} % (fold)
    \label{sub:fishing_mortality}

    Many large crab fisheries impose a minimum size limits and prohibit the retention of female crabs as a conservation tool.  The probability dying due to fishing comes in two forms, an individual is captured and retained, or the same individual is discarded and dies prematurely due to handling effects.  The retained portion of the catch is generally a measurable quantity; however the discard mortality component cannot be directly measured.  To account for these to mutually exclusive events we use the following joint probability to model vulnerability due to fishing mortality by gear $k$ at length category $l$ (ignoring sex for clarity)
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:selectivity}
      \nu_{k,l}  = s_{k,l} [y_{k,l} + (1-y_{k,l})\xi_{k}],
    \end{equation}
    where $s_{k,l}$ is the probability of catching an animal of length $l$, $y_{k,l}$ is the probability of retaining an individual in fishery $k$, and $\xi_{k}$ is the discard mortality rate for fishery $k$.
